This is the pact I made with you: to reclaim this world from the ‘gods’ once again. And your first target, according to my prophecy, is a strange ‘forest’.",

This is the last thing I can do, I want to tell you - no matter who picks up this note, what I want to warn you is, fire! Burn this forest with fire, no, it’s not a forest anymore! Just like the empire’s most important tributary state, it is completely different from its original interior! According to the preliminary observation of the accompanying priest, the people of this country are parasitized by a peculiar spore, their minds are in a vague state, they will only aimlessly gather together and wander, but when attacked, they will fiercely counterattack, I privately call them ‘the lost’. We want to reach… uh, my heart is in severe pain… God, there is something green wriggling there… Well, we found that the source of all this seems to come from that palace, the closer we get, the more we can hear a whisper ‘Fick… Fowos…’",
