In this world (we don’t have a specific term to describe it, we simply call it “the world,” but perhaps for you, it could be called “another world”), there are many races living: the “Three Great Races” that exist today—Humans, Animen, Blood Elves, as well as some “Legendary Races” that haven’t appeared for a while—Dwarves, Dragons, etc., and the “Extinct” Vampires, and… “Gods.”",

This is the pact I made with you: to reclaim this world from the ‘gods’ once again. And your first target, according to my prophecy, is a strange ‘forest’.",

I put the lantern beside me, deluding myself that it could bring me a few strands of warmth, just as I delude myself that this note could be seen by someone. This is the last thing I can do, I want to tell you - no matter who picks up this note, what I want to warn you is, fire! Burn this forest with fire, no, it’s not a forest anymore! Just like the empire’s most important tributary state, it is completely different from its original interior! According to the preliminary observation of the accompanying priest, the people of this country are parasitized by a peculiar spore, their minds are in a vague state, they will only aimlessly gather together and wander, but when attacked, they will fiercely counterattack, I privately call them ‘the lost’. We want to reach… uh, my heart is in severe pain… God, there is something green wriggling there… Well, we found that the source of all this seems to come from that palace, the closer we get, the more we can hear a whisper ‘Fick… Fowos…’",
  "task_progress.1.1.0": "When we entered there, I saw something I had never seen in my life, I turned my head and ran, my duty as an imperial scout is not to fight with that thing, just to quickly pass this information back, ‘as long as the empire’s caster troops launch an attack, everything will be resolved.’ When I ran with this thought, a scream came from behind, and then my chain armor was completely shattered, my body was hit by something, it seems that the thing that parasitized me drilled into my body at this time, my eyelids are getting heavier and heavier… May I be blessed, no matter which god, I don’t want to become a monster… (The handwriting ends here)”",
